# Securing and extending Splunk Free Edition
A collection of scripts and configurations that enhance Splunk Free by adding access control (user/admin login), preventing license violations by stopping ingesting, and providing workarounds for missing alerting feature.

There are several versions of Splunk software: Splunk Enterprise (a paid version) and Splunk Free. Splunk Free is a limited version (https://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/Splunk/latest/Admin/MoreaboutSplunkFree). Here are the most important limitations:

* Daily Volume Ingestion Restriction:
  * Splunk Free allows indexing up to 500 MB of data per day.
  * If you exceed this limit, youâ€™ll receive a license violation warning.
  * After three warnings within a rolling 30-day period, searching functionality is disabled.
* Removed Features:
  * Alerting (Monitoring): Not available in Splunk Free.
  * User Authentication and Roles:
    * There are no users or roles.
    * You are automatically logged in as an administrator-level user without any credentials.
Even with these limitations Splunk Free is still very useful.

Splunk Free Extensions is a collection of scripts and configurations that enhance Splunk Free and allows:
* configure a reverse proxy to add access control:
  * create login (username/password)
  * user "admin" can access everything and modify system settings
  * user "user" cannot modify system settings
* provides a workaround to configure alert actions by using cron and bash scripts
* stop splunk input if the license usage reaches 500MB
* etc.

## Access Control

The access control (login with username/password) can be enabled by putting Splunk behind a reverse proxy with a basic authentication. Only authenticated user can access Splunk. A direct access to Splunk is restricted by modifing splunk-launch.conf by configuring SPLUNK_BINDIP=127.0.0.1. On the reverse proxy you can configure several users that belong to two categories: users and admin. Users can do anything except modifing system settings. This is done by denying access to /manager/ URI path. Admins have access to all settings.

## Alerts

To configuring an alert a cron job need to be configured that call a script that run a CLI SPL code and return results to the script. An example how to handle splunk stats results is provided. An Email action is provided in example (using mail or swacks command).
A throttle function (suppressing subsequent alerts until the throttle period is expired) is realised by creating a timestamp file.

## Prevent license violations

Splunk inputs can be disabled when the license reaches the daily limit and re-enabled at 00:00.

## Setup

### Configure reverse proxy to enable access control

Following steps were tested with Ubuntu 24.04 LTS
```
apt install apache2
cp splunk.conf /etc/apache2/sites-enabled/splunk.conf  # copy provided apache config
vi /etc/apache2/ports.conf                             # add a port for reverse proxy to listen on, ex. Listen 10.20.30.40:8000
a2enmod proxy proxy_http                               # enable proxy module
htpasswd -c /etc/apache2/.htpasswd user                # add a new user
htpasswd    /etc/apache2/.htpasswd admin               # add a new admin
systemctl restart apache2                              # restart apache

vi /opt/splunk/etc/splunk-launch.conf                  # add SPLUNK_BINDIP=127.0.0.1 to bind Splunk to localhost
systemctl restart Splunkd                              # restart Splunk
```

### Configure cron to enable Splunk alerts
```
vi splunk_free_alert.sh # modify SPL and mail parameters
chmod +x splunk_free_alert.sh
crontab -e # create a cronjob
```
