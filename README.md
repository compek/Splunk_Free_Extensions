# Splunk_Free_Extensions
A collection of scripts and configurations that enhance Splunk Free by adding access control (user/admin login), preventing license violations by stopping ingesting, and providing workarounds for alerting.

* configure a reverse proxy to add login.
* create login (username/password)
* admin user can access everything
* user "user" cannot access /manager/
* provides a workaround to configure alert actions
* stop splunk input if the license usage reaches 500MB
* etc.
