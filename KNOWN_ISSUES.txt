### Known Issues

* restart using UI doesn't work, an auth dialog get before a dialog "restart Splunk", use CLI instead

* Splunk doesn't start, the port is not available (Splunk run on 127.0.0.1:8000). Problem: http has already bind the port
Solution #1: start Splunk before httpd:
systemctl stop httpd
systemctl stop Splunkd
systemctl start Splunkd # start Splunk first, so it passes the port check
systemctl start httpd # httpd starts after Splunk

Solution #2: run httpd on other port
