### Known Issues

* restart using UI doesn't work, an auth dialog get before a dialog "restart Splunk", use CLI instead

* Splunk doesn't start, the port is not available. Problem: http has already bind the port:
systemctl stop httpd
systemctl stop Splunkd
systemctl start Splunkd # start Splunk first, so it passes the port check
systemctl start httpd # httpd starts after Splunk
